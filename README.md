User Story
AS A web developer
I WANT to be able to make changes to a website so that it looks more polished
SO THAT when you look at the html and css files, unnecessary code has been removed

##Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code, any unnecessary coding is removed
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, and remove any unnecessary lines
WHEN I view the icon and image elements, they're are positioned correctly
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
