# Modifying-Horiseon-Webpage

## Description
As a web developer
I need to be able to make changes to a website so that it looks more polished,
so that when you look at the html and css files, unnecessary code has been removed.

## Usage
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code, any unnecessary coding is removed

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, and remove any unnecessary lines

WHEN I view the icon and image elements, they're are positioned correctly
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
